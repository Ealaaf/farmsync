# FarmSync - Weather Widget Expansion

This is the alpha prototype for the expansion screen of the weather widget. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data across a set list of locations in Malaysia. It then pairs the weather condition data from the corresponding endpoint with a sound, which is then played back using the Web Audio API. Optionally, the Giphy API implementation is also available for dynamic video backgrounds.
